/**
 * Force-runs a batch of migrations that were ported from Mihon with low version numbers
 * (131f–139f) but were silently skipped in Tadami.
 *
 * Tadami's BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE is significantly higher than Mihon's (currently 187+).
 * When a user upgrades (e.g. last_version_code=182 → 187), the VersionRangeMigrationStrategy
 * only considers migrations whose version.toInt() falls into (old+1)..new.
 *
 * All these low-numbered migrations fell outside the range for users who were already
 * past ~146, causing data, preferences, and job setups to be lost or left in legacy state.
 *
 * This wrapper is registered at 187f. It is safe to call the individual migrations again
 * because they are defensive (they check whether the work has already been done).
 *
 * ExtensionRepoToStoreMigration is NOT always-on: it is registered at 187f like this class, so an
 * upgrade that jumps past 187 never runs it. That is fine because the port also runs on demand from
 * ExtensionStoreRepository.getAll(), which trust checks and the store screens both go through.
